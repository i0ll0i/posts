## How to Install Grafana on CentOS Stream 9
Since the Grafana repository is not included by default in CentOS Stream, you need to manually add the official Grafana repository to your systemâ€™s repository list.
To do this navigate to the directory `/etc/yum.repos.d/`:
```
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
```
Add the official Grafana repository by creating a new repository configuration file in the directory `/etc/yum.repos.d/`:

sudo vi grafana.repo
```

[grafana]
name=grafana
baseurl=https://packages.grafana.com/oss/rpm
repo_gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key
```
Save the file and exit.
